# Victor Fateh Personal Website

Originally built in 2014 as my first serious college freshman project.

This was my first attempt at making a website. The goal was to provide a clear view into who I was and what I was building.

It's now filled with spaghetti code and plenty of happy accidents.

It's a great learning example and I occasionally come back to clean things up.
